// Program lines of code
$apollo11 = 145000;
$android = 12000000;
$osx = 86000000;

// Step 1: Create a variable named 'myLines' and set it's value equal to the integer 4000000

// Step 2: Use an if statement to check whether 'myLines' is greater than $osx, and if so, display the string "You have written more code than is included in MacOS 10.4."

// Step 3: Add an else if statement to check whether 'myLines' is greater than $android, and if so, display the string "You have written more code than it takes to run an Android phone."

// Step 4: Add another else if statement to check whether 'myLines' is greater than $apollo11, and if so, display the string "You have written more code than it took to launch Apollo 11."

// Step 5: Add an else statement to display the string "Keep writing code to accomplish something great!"

// Step 6: Test your code by changing the value of 'myLines' until you have reached all possibilities. (examples: -14552880, 45000000, 1449100800)
